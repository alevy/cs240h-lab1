# Word Frequency Histogram (Lab 1) - CS240h: Functional Systems in Haskell

Author: Amit Levy (levya@cs.stanford.edu)

## Build Instructions

Use `cabal` to build the word frequency histogram generator from the source directory:
    
    $ cabal configure
    $ cabal build
    
This builds the executable `hist` into the dist directory. You should be able to run
    
    $ dist/build/hist/hist [text-file]
    
You can also install the binary by running:
    
    $ cabal install
    

## Usage
    
    hist [text-file]
    
If a file is given, `hist` will read it in as a text file. Otherwise it will read from standard input.
